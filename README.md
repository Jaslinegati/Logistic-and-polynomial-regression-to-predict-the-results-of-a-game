# A prediction result of a game between two teams  
1) Defining the question
Predicting the result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

a) Objectives
Main Objective
Predicting the result of a game between two teams

Speecific Objectives

Create two models where:

Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.

Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

b) Metrics For Success
1)Exhaustively performed polynomial regression done by performing feature engineering where necessary.

2)Exhaustively perform Logistic regression by performing feature engineering where necessary

c) Context
The prediction sites and comapnies have become relatively on - demand sites .Everyone is beginning to recognise the opportunity of making money through sports betting. Unlike other forms of gambling, football prediction has a wider range of selection of possibilities to bet from, which makes it a lot easier for punters to place bets based on their knowledge of teams and leagues. Hence the need to create a model for a company that helps them know the odds

d) Experimental Designs
i) Data Exploration Importing Libraries Loading Dataset Cleaning Data Determine Relationship between variables(Univariate, Multivariate)

ii) Feature engineering

iii) Statistical Inferences

iv) Logistic regression

v) Polynomial regression
